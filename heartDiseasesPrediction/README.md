Predicting Heart Diseases via Decision Trees & Random Forests
14 - 28 April 2022


Technologies Used: Scala/Spark

Acquired dataset from Kaggle.

Implemented a machine learning pipeline for Decision Tree and Random Forest models (Binary classification problem).

The pipeline is used to initialize 5-fold cross-validation across specified hyperparameters.

Measured accuracy based on the BinaryClassificationMetric of scala. 90% of the data was used for training and 10% for test.

Achieved the following results:
	Accuracy for the Decision Tree: 0.5156347280943666
	Accuracy for the RandomForest: 0.5
