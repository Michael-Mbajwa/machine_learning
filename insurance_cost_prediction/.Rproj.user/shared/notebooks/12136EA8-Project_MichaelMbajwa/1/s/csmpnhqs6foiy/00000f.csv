"0","# But first:"
"0","# So far, we have only considered each feature's individual contribution to the outcome. What if certain features have a combined impact on the dependent variable? For instance, smoking and bmi may have harmful effects separately, but it is reasonable to assume that their combined effect may be worse than the sum of each one alone. When two features have a combined effect, this is known as an interaction. If we suspect that two variables interact, we can test this hypothesis by adding their interaction to the model"

"0","# so what I will do is to find the combined effect of the three features most correlated with charges and see which combination gives the best r2 score"
