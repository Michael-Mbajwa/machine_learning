"0","# Interpreting the linear model"
"0","# We wont interpret the intercept in this case as it is impossible to have all features as 0. age and bmi for instance can't be zero."
"0","# For any age increase, we would expect 265.53 increase in cost all things considered"
"0","# Each additional child increases cost by 501.46 "
"0","# Not being a smoker decreases cost by 23819.15"
"0","# Being male increases cost by 90.05"
"0","# Increase in bmi increases cost by 328.71"
"0","# Basically the linear model is saying being a smoker, old age, higher bmi and more children increases health costs"
