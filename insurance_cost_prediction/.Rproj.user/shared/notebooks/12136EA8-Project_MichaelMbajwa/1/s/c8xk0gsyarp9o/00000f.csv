"0","# Looking at the summary statistics"
"0","# Residuals: True value - Predicted value. Looking at the maximum error, we can see our model wrongly predicts cost by a margin of 29745.6. Quite huge. Majority of the predictions can be seen to be 2800 over the true value and 1540 under the true value."
"0","# The Adjusted R-squared value  0.7561 shows us that almost 75% of the variation in cost can be explained by the model."
